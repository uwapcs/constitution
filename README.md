See [the latest release](../../releases/latest) for a compiled PDF of the constitution, or [view it in your browser](../latest-release/uwapcs_constitution.pdf).

You can also [download a compiled PDF](../../raw/master-build/uwapcs_constitution.pdf) of the latest `master` branch version or [view it in your browser](../master-build/uwapcs_constitution.pdf). Note that this should but does not necessarily reflect the current official version.

The constitution is written in LaTeX. Please maintain a history of amendments as part of the file, and roll a new release when the constitution is amended. [A GitHub Action](.github/workflows/release.yml) will automatically build the PDF and add it to the release.
